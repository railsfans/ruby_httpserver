HTTPServer
=========

This demo is clone from https://github.com/sayonarauniverse/magic_server.git. I have fix some bug and add database connect function. Only for learn.

### What it can do (for now)

1. Handles GET and POST requests. 
2. Uses servlets to mess with views with ruby. 
3. Handles ERB views.
4. Reads and sets cookies
5. Connect mysql database

### Quick Start

Open up a terminal and type:

1. git clone https://github.com/railsfans/ruby_httpserver.git
2. cd magic_server && cd example
3. ruby run (or if you're windows, just 'run')
4. Open a browser and type in 'localhost:3000'

Todo: Fix SSL
