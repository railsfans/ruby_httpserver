MagicServer
=========

This is my attempt to write a basic web server from scratch. I was inspired to write this after realizing how little I know about web servers despite doing web development every day.

### What it can do (for now)

1. Handles GET and POST requests. 
2. Uses servlets to mess with views with ruby. 
3. Handles ERB views.
4. Reads and sets cookies

### Quick Start

Open up a terminal and type:

1. git clone https://github.com/sayonarauniverse/magic_server.git
2. cd magic_server && cd example
3. ruby run (or if you're windows, just 'run')
4. Open a browser and type in 'localhost:3333'
